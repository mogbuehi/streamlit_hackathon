The sensory seismic level is 2, but all of our observation measurements are showing a level 8. I can't believe this is happening. Would you look at that? It's crazy! It's just not right!\n\nMary, you shouldn't be out here in your condition. But Joe, this is the first phenomenon like this in all of history. I'm well aware of that, but...

Welcome to the Night of Wonderland. I am Fabula. The Conjunction. Yes, twelve years ago, that was the day when the Pillar of the Darkness of Chaos first appeared. But now, a new journey. A new beginning.\n\nA wandering is about to begin. A wandering in a new place. Wonderland. Seems like even the tortoise can stop coming in such big numbers.\n\nIt's no wonder, because I heard another ship disappeared. See? I'm sure the pillar is somehow connected to Wonderland. And all the subway workers are constantly disappearing too, so... It's been closed for a while now, hasn't it? What if we don't end up being able to come back either? What do we do? We'll be fine. We know that Mom and Dad made it back at least once.\n\nSee anything we still got two or three minutes to go so hey sis aren't you even scared we're going to look for mom and dad you know there's no time to be scared right now well yeah I guess you're right\n\nIt's coming. I know it. It's really true. Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah! \n\nWhat do we do, sis? It's dark. You think? Getting in? Of course! I mean, that's why we came here, right? Listen! That sounds like the departure bell! It must be getting ready to leave! Hurry!\n\n\u3042\u3042\u3042\u3042\u3042\u3042\u3042\n\nIt's just a normal subway train, but mom and dad took this train, didn't they? This is pacifist reporting. I am currently on- Someone else is here, you!\n\nWell, good evening. Don't play nicey with us. Who are you and how'd you get on? I... Watch your manners, sis. I'm real sorry, miss. It's fine. Who are you? A couple of ghosts that live on this train? You're the one who's a ghost here. Cut it out already, sis. Huh. We were hoping we were on the train to Wonderland now. You see, we're searching for our missing mom and dad. Wonderland? Yeah. They say that the pillar...\n\ndarkness is in some way connected to the magical world of Wonderland. At least that's what my dad wrote in his book here. Day of Conjunction, the book from Professor Hayakawa famous for research on the physics of Wonderland. They wrote in there that when they went to Wonderland they took a subway train. We checked it out online. We found out about a rumor that said you could get on the train at precisely 13 seconds past 1213 a.m. on a full moon night. I'm Yu Hayakawa and this\n\nover here is my older sister and I'm I he calls me his older sister but we're twins oh I'm Lisa so why are you on the subway well I don't know\n\nit looks like we've stopped it's about time mom and dad should be here somewhere it looks like we can climb up well let's get climbing that's why we came here isn't it well that's why we came here isn't it I think I see an exit up there hey miss are you also looking for someone\n\nwho's disappeared in Wonderland I'm sure it's her boyfriend huh you know you can call me Lisa if you want to hmm ah finally is this the place this it what is this place is it really wonderland\n\nlooks like a normal place to me except for the sky you guys try and stick close to me I have a bad feeling here this is just a regular slide just like any other\n\nWhat happened? I should have known better. This place isn't normal! It's Wonderland! Whee! Huh? Who's over there? Huh. Huh. Huh. Huh. Huh. Huh. Huh. Well hi there.\n\nthere hey look what I've got for you hold on it's all right here you go it's a joke a joke a joke a joke a chocolate for you excuse me what do you think you're doing with our food supply well\n\nAre you okay? Look at the pretty stars! Maybe that was one of those birds of happiness that live in Wonderland. See? Like in the book that mom and dad wrote. Mr. Birdie! Come back! Wait a minute, you! Mr. Birdie! Do you think you might have seen our parents? Well, where do you think he disappeared to?\n\nOh, oh, what? Hey! What happened? Look, there's someone stuck in there. Do you think he's dead? Ah! Where is this place?\n\nWe were gonna ask you the same thing too, mister. Did you just wander into Wonderland also? Wonderland? So, is that scoundrel here too? I don't know who you mean, but are you looking for someone too, scoundrel? Who are you anyway? I have forgotten my name and who I am.\n\nThat's not good. Huh? What is that thing? Some kind of flying machine. You think there's someone in it? I don't think so. I feel a real bad flow of energy from it. It can't be human. That can't be good. Everyone run!\n\nKeep running! A mushroom? It's looking at us!\n\nI think he's bad. Do you think he's going to attack now? Probably so. Just a minute. Just a minute.\n\noh wow that was incredible i knew there was something weird about you no that was only a little keegan hart's move i know just a small trick it's sort of kind of like a martial art keegan arts huh\n\nI'm doing your trick on that one! But I can't, he's too big! Better run. It's catching up with us! Try and find a place where you can hide! It's a glimpse!\n\nYou guys okay? Yeah, for now. Now this really doesn't look good. \n\nIt's that man from before. He survived that blast? Hey, help us! It has moved. Soil is my power.\n\nThe Magan has thawed. Magan? Magan? \n\nA soil charge triad to use on you has been decided. The origin of all things, Mother Black. A heat that will scorch all creation, Fire Red. And finally, the Red.\n\ncritical point of everything. Burning gold. What an amazing energy. Burn up! I summon you! Phoenix!\n\n\u0905\u092a\u0930 \u0905\u092a\u0930 \u0905\u092a\u0930 \u0905\u092a\u0930 \u0905\u092a\u0930 \u0905\u092a\u0930 \u0905\u092a\u0930 \u0905\u092a\u0930 \u0905\u092a\u0930 \u0905\u092a\u0930 \u0905\u092a\u0930 \u0905\u092a\u0930 \u0905\u092a\u0930 \u0905\u092a\u0930 \u0905\u092a\u0930 \u0905\u092a\u0930 \u0905\u092a\u0930 \u0905\u092a\u0930 \u0905\u092a\u0930 \u0905\u092a\u0930 \u0905\u092a\u0930 \u0905\u092a\u0930 \ufffd\n\n\u5feb\u8d70\n\nAmazing!
