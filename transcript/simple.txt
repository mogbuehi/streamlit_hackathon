Alright, so here's the app idea. You make, so you take the transcript, you make a lesson plan. The lesson plan is simple. It just explains the words, explains the words, the structure of what's going on, and then it just creates flashcards, and then the next part is it creates flashcards and asks you to go practice. It gives you the flashcards.

Maybe that we create a way for you to look through and flip through the flashcards, or maybe it outputs an Anki file or something, some kind of file, some kind of Anki something. I think there's actually a Python Anki library. So it outputs an Anki file. Maybe I can have her work on that part. I'll put Anki.

file that that card can have the video segment of where the word or phrase came from and then maybe you can test what does it mean and how to how to even spell the words you can do Romaji and then maybe the hiragana katakana kanji

if you want to learn how to write it as well. And then the most important thing is accountability feature. So this is beyond what we submit to the Streamlit. This is more about how to create a community of learners and fans who are enthusiastic about this stuff, and they hold each other accountable. There's got to be some type of goal towards the end, maybe, but I think it's really important that we're doing it. And I think that's a really important thing. And I think that's a really important thing. And I think that's a really important thing. And I think that's a really important thing. And I think that's a really important thing. And I think that's a really important thing. And I think that's a really important thing. And I think that's a really important thing. And I think that's a really important thing. And I think that's a really important thing. And I think that's a really important thing. And I think that's a really important thing.

You guys are all gonna go on a trip somewhere. You guys are all gonna go to Japan or something. Or you're all gonna go watch this movie. And you're gonna try and watch it without subtitles. I mean, you can connect it to events. You're gonna go to a concert. Hey, let's all learn the lyrics to this song so that when we go to the concert, we can all sing along, you know? Yeah, it can be something like that. Like, just connect it to fun events that are coming around.

and that just goes to the whole idea of what this application, this website, this social media community that I'm going to build. It's just about how to connect people. Yeah, how to connect people and make anime, Japanese media, a way to connect people. Yeah.
